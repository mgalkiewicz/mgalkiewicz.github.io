      Hi, I’m Maciej. I’m endlessly curious about how the world works.
<br><br>
I read across disciplines—history, biographies, business, marketing, investing, psychology, fiction, and more—to explore how people think, act, and build.
<br><br>
I live in Berlin with my wife and two kids. I love riding motorcycles, listening to music (preferably loud), working out at the gym, and escaping to Italy whenever I can. Sport has always been part of my life, and these days I mostly train in the gym.

## My Work

Over the past 10+ years, I’ve gone from being a system administrator to taking over and scaling a company. Almost overnight, I became the CEO of [Ragnarson](https://ragnarson.com)—a software development company—where I led a team of 60 people. That experience taught me a lot about leadership, responsibility, and what it means to grow with your company.

I’ve also invested in and worked closely with startups, particularly in the **climate tech** space. I’ve helped founders challenge their assumptions, build better systems, and make more grounded decisions.

## What I’m Exploring Now

Lately, I’ve been diving deep into **decision-making**. As a founder, I’ve faced tough decisions—some I navigated well, others not so much. That experience sparked a deeper interest in how decisions are made.

Right now, I’m exploring:

- Decision-making frameworks
- Cognitive biases and heuristics
- Probabilistic and Bayesian thinking
- Complexity and systems thinking
- Incentives and game theory
- The role of personal values, identity, and context in shaping decisions

If you’re working in this space or just curious about it, I’d love to connect.

## What I Bring to the Table

People often tell me my strengths lie in:

- Discipline and commitment
- Quickly assessing systems for gaps, contradictions, and inefficiencies
- Asking sharp, sometimes uncomfortable, questions
- Building relationships and trust quickly
